This code is a class called standardAtmosphere. It performs calculations
and returns standard atmosphere values at a specific altitude. Each
atmospheric property is its own function within the class, and there is
an SI conversion function as well. Each function returns the value at the
requested altitude and a separate string for units.

It includes the properties:

    properties at a requested altitude and a unit conversion function.

        This function returns the temperature in deg F
        of a US standard day at the requested altitude.
