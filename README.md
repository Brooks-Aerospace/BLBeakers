# Brooks Aero Design Suite

---=== Welcome to the Brooks Aerospace Design Suite! ===---


This is an open-source suite of aerospace design tools and examples.
Please see [the license](LICENSE.md) for detailed info on usage.

This suite will contain multiple aerospace design tools, setup guides,
and usage examples.
Many tools will be open-source. If a tool being used is not open source,
the user must obtain a license on their own to use it.

Below are the descriptions of each tool. See the <README.md> files linked
below for detailed information (including licensing info
and download locations).

## Custom Tools
#### Description:
A collection of custom calculators and other tools developed by BADS.

#### List of Tools:
- Seaplane takeoff distance estimator
                                      
## OpenVSP
[OpenVSP Readme](OpenVSP/README.md)
#### Description:
OpenVSP (vehicle sketch pad) is a low-fidelity, open source, parametric
aircraft geometry tool. It can be used to generate models of aircraft
and perform simple parameterized analysis and aero simulations on them.       

#### BADS Features: 
- vehicle features import
- weight and balance/CG calculation
- tail/canard/wing sizing
    - simple and complex wing import

## OpenAeroVTOL
[OAV Readme](OAV/README.md)
#### Description:

#### BADS Features:
- software download and GUI easy zip

## DFDC
[DFDC Readme](DFDC/README.md)
#### Description:
DFDC (ducted fan design code) is an analysis tool for axisymmetric ducted
rotor design and analysis. It can be used to generate geometries of ducted
rotors and perform analysis and geometric development on them.

#### BADS Features:
coming soon

## XFOIL
[XFOIL Readme](XFOIL/README.md)
#### Description:
XFOIL is a subsonic airfoil design and optimization tool.

#### BADS Features:
coming soon

## Flightstream
[Flightstream Readme](Flightstream/README.MD)
#### Description:
Flightstream is a medium-fidelity aircraft analysis tool. It can perform
medium fidelity aerodynamic analysis on complex aircraft designs with high
accuracy in a fraction of the time of CFD. It supports CAD geometry and has
built in meshing for ease of setup.

#### BADS Features:
coming soon
